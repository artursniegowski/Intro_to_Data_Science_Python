# 04_Combine_Google_Trends_with_other_Data

This analysis shows how to combine Google trends with web searches from https://trends.google.com/trends in comparison to some other data. The popularity of search terms can tell us a lot about future trends. In this particular example, three main data sets were examined.</br>
1. Bitcoin search volume in comparison to Bitcoin prices</br>
2. The relationship between Tesla's stock price and Tesla search volume</br>
3. Unemployment Rate vs. Unemployment Benefits Search Volume</br>
For getting the bitcoin, the Tesla stock price, https://finance.yahoo.com/quote was used.
For getting the unemployment rate,https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE/Â was used.
In order to match the data, resampling of dates and time series was necessary.
