# 07_Seaborn_and_Linear_Regression

This project will have a focus on analysing data about films. Data was scraped on May 1, 2018 from
https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets .In this analysis, we will explore the different aspects of how the budget of a movie influences the revenue, and also how to predict future revenue based on the budget and year it was filmed.
Different Python libraries were used. like the visualisation library [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html), which is based on Matplotlib for generating different kinds of charts (bubble chart, scatter chart, regressions). as well as the open source data analysis library [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (the gold standard for machine learning), which was used to calculate the data for linear regression, check how accurate our model is, and make predictions about future revenue.

The necessary steps to make the program work:</br>
1. Install the required libraries from the requirements.txt using the following command: </br>
*pip install -r requirements.txt*</br>
2. Explore data in the main.ipynb where Python code can be run in blocks.</br>
3. Using Colab from google https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html explore data from main.ipynb.</br>
