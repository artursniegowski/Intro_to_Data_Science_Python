# 09_Hospital_Birth_Deaths_Analysis

In this project, we're going to analyse data (http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/the%20etiology,%20concept%20and%20prophylaxis%20of%20childbed%20fever.pdf) that was collected by Dr. Semmelweis in the 1800s on deaths of women in maternity wards from childbed fever. Some highlights from the analysis include,
percentage of women dying in childbirth, visualising the total number of births and deaths over time.
And we will also look more closely into the effect of handwashing, calculating the difference in the average monthly death rate based on handwashing and using histograms to visualise the monthly distribution of outcomes (percentage of deaths).</br>
The main libraries used in this analysis were:</br>
[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html), which is based on Matplotlib for generating different kinds of charts.</br>
[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), it's Python graphing library, makes interactive, publication-quality graphs.</br>
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualisations in Python.</br>
[SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/index.html) is an open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering (for calculating the t-statistic and the p-value).</br>

The necessary steps to make the program work:</br>
1. Install the required libraries from the requirements.txt using the following command: </br>
*pip install -r requirements.txt*</br>
2. Explore data in the main.ipynb where Python code can be run in blocks.</br>
3. Using Colab from google https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html explore data from main.ipynb.</br>
