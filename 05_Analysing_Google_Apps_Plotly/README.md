# 05_Analysing_Google_Apps_Plotly

This analysis focuses on data about Google apps scraped from the Google Play Store by Lavanya Gupta in 2018. The original files are available [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps).
The main points were depicting interesting facts about Google Apps with the help of Python libry plotly, and
using diverse charts, like pie, bar, box, and many more.</br>
The data about Google apps was explored to find out interesting facts like:</br>
* how competitive various app categories (for example, games, lifestyle, and weather) are,</br>
* What are the most popular apps,</br>
* What was the most downloaded app's estimated revenue,</br>
* how the monetization of an app affects its download count,</br>
* What is a reasonable price for an app,</br>
