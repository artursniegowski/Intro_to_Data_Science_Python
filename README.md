# Intro_to_Data_Science_Python
This is a repository of projects that will teach you the most important libraries and concepts used in data science with the help of Python. The programs below will demonstrate how easy and efficient Python is, and why it is one of the most popular and widely used language in data science. Have fun and enjoy the codding!


## 01_Analysing_Salaries_of_Graduates_by_Major
Basic operations using the Pandas library for data exploration. As an example, data from salaries_by_college_major.csv was
used and explored with Python Library Pandas. In order to have a better understanding and manipulation of data, the Jupyter Notebook was used, which is an interactive computing platform.
In this example, the salaries of post-university graduates by major are being analised.

## 02_Analyse_Popularity_of_Programming_Languages
Each post on Stack Overflow comes with a tag. And this tag can be the name of a programming language. Based on that, we will gather data from stackoverflow and generate a csv file containing information on various programming languages and
the number of times each language is tagged in a post. This will help us to determine which programming language is the most popular.
The analysis is carried out using the Python Library Pandas, and the results are plotted using the Python Library Matplotlib.Â
